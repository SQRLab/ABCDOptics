# ABCDOptics
WARNING: This code was written so that I could learn how ABCD matrices work. Currenlty, it does not work as intended. If you know how to fix this
please let me know. You can email calebcw@uw.edu or (since you're probably a lab member) just let me know and we can update it.

Simple ABCD matrix operation module. You can give the code an initial wavelength, beamwaist, position (z-value) and angle.
It will then propagate it through the optical system that you design and return the final beamwaist, position and angle.

If you look at example there is a short demonstration on how to use the code.
Not all ABCD matrices have been implemented but it should be easy enough to add more as needed.
