# ABCDOptics
Simple ABCD matrix operation module. You can give the code an initial wavelength, beamwaist, position (z-value) and angle.
It will then propagate it through the optical system that you design and return the final beamwaist, position and angle.

If you look at example there is a short demonstration on how to use the code.
Not all ABCD matrices have been implemented but it should be easy enough to add more as needed.
Currently, radius of curvature has not been added in.
